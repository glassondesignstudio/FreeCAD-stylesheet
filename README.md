# FreeCAD-stylesheet

This repository contains the FreeCAD stylesheet used by the Glasson Design Studio (GDS) YouTube channel.

The GDS YouTube channel records in 4K and the standard FreeCAD stylesheets don't seem to support this resolution very well. This stylesheet is an attempt to improve the look of FreeCAD at 4K resolution to make it easier for visually impaired people to see read the screen, and to make it easier to use overall.

This stylesheet is derived from the FreeCAD standard sytlesheet - Light-blue.
